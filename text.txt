GET - sends data in an open request to the server, mostly integrate as key=value pair in URL
POST - is mostly used to communicate with the server in hidden format not like as GET. Also, It is used to send sensitive data to the server.

HTTP request is sent by client to the server to request specific data using HTTP format protocol.
